Meeting with Jason to discus the design document and the design review. We have to update the design document because we are still missing the schematic and a calendar with the deadlines that we want to meet.

Also discussed what components we should buy, started to talk about the voltage divider, is it best to do it with one component already made or to buy two resistors and make it ourselves in the PCB board? (we need 100:1 voltage ratio and 10Mohms input impedance).
After looking at some components we couldn't find any available voltage divider that meet our criteria because the most aqqurate one could be the Vishay #CDMA15M0D2500DE5 that has 15Mohms input impedance but it has a voltage ratio of 250:1 which means we will have to amplify the voltage output, having to add more components and potencially adding error.
